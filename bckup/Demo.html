                    <h1> TYPES OF ANIMALS </h1>
			<p>Earth is the only known planet up to date which sustains life. A few millions years ago, <strong>Earth was home to the one of the most vicious 
                           and devastating creatures well-known to mankind ̶ dinosaur.</strong> Wrapped in a cocoon of evolution, Earth, along with most living beings, 
                           had endured metamorphosis, transforming the world to what it is now. Gigantic deadly dinosaurs went extinct, whilst only a minority 
                           that survived mutated into smaller-sized animals.Animals that roam the Earth are classified into three major categories, namely mammals, 
                           reptiles and amphibians, where each category is further divided into their respective orders</p>

<p> Mammals are sub-divided into two distinct groups: <em> <strong>Prototheria and Theria </strong> </em>(Eisenberg & Redford, 1999). Members of the subclass Prototheria lay eggs like most non-mammalian vertebrates. 
However, they feed their newborn with mammary gland secretions like all other mammals. <em>They lack nipples, but the skin over their mammary glands exude milk for their babies</em>. 
The Prototheria are also referred to as monotremes, which literally means that they have one opening for excretion and reproduction. This is similar to birds and reptiles. 
On the other hand, all other living mammalian species, including humans, are in the subclass Theria.</p>
